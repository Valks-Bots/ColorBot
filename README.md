# ColorBot
## About
A discord bot that gives a random color to every member in a guild.

## Contribute to ColorBot
The bot could use alot of extra features to make it easier to use and more friendly.
- Bot needs a counter to show progress of completion when adding all the roles in console.
- Make the bot get the random colors set from a command instead of hard coded in the tokens.json.
- Add a command to generate color roles.
- Add fail safe permission checks.
